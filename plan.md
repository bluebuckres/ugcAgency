### Responsive Design Patterns

**Mobile-First Approach**:
- Design for mobile first, enhance for desktop
- Touch-friendly targets (44x44px minimum)
- Simplified navigation
- Stacked layouts
- Larger tap areas for CTAs

**Breakpoint Behaviors**:

**Mobile (< 640px)**:
- Single column layouts
- Hamburger navigation
- Full-width CTAs
- Collapsed sections with expand/collapse
- Simplified forms (one column)

**Tablet (640px - 1024px)**:
- Two-column grids
- Partial desktop nav (may still use hamburger)
- Side-by-side content where appropriate
- Larger touch targets maintained

**Desktop (1024px+)**:
- Full multi-column layouts
- Horizontal navigation
- Hover effects enabled
- Sidebars and multi-column forms
- Larger imagery

**Large Screens (1280px+)**:
- Max-width containers to prevent stretching
- Balanced whitespace
- Optional multi-column text (where readable)

### Accessibility Requirements

**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**:
- Color contrast minimum 4.5:1 for text
- Focus indicators visible and clear
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Alt text for all images
- Form labels properly associated
- Error messages descriptive and helpful

**Semantic HTML**:
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3)
- `<nav>` for navigation
- `<main>` for main content
- `<article>` for blog posts
- `<section>` for page sections
- `<button>` for buttons (not divs)
- `<a>` for links with href

**Screen Reader Support**:
- Skip-to-content link
- Descriptive link text (avoid "click here")
- Image alt text contextual
- Form error announcements
- Loading state announcements

### Performance Optimization

**Loading Strategy**:
- Critical CSS inline
- Lazy load images below fold
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Preload hero images
- Optimize font loading (font-display: swap)

**Image Optimization**:
- WebP format with fallbacks
- Responsive images (srcset)
- Appropriate sizing (no oversized images)
- Compression without quality loss
- Placeholder blur effect while loading

**Animation Performance**:
- Use CSS transforms (not position properties)
- Limit to opacity and transform animations
- Use will-change sparingly
- RequestAnimationFrame for JS animations
- Reduce motion for accessibility preference

### Content Guidelines

**Copy Best Practices**:
- Short paragraphs (3-4 lines max)
- Sentence variety (mix short and medium)
- Active voice preferred
- Bullet points for scanability
- Bold key phrases (not entire sentences)
- Numbers over words (3 not three)
- Avoid jargon unless necessary

**Tone of Voice**:
- Confident but not arrogant
- Friendly but professional
- Data-driven but human
- Clear and direct (no fluff)
- Action-oriented (use strong verbs)
- Honest and transparent

**Call-to-Action Copy**:
- Action verbs ("Get," "Start," "Calculate," "Download")
- Value-clear ("Get Your Free Audit")
- Urgency where appropriate ("Limited Spots")
- Specific ("Book 30-Min Call" not "Contact Us")
- Benefit-focused ("See Your ROI" not "Use Calculator")

// UGC Impact (customize these multipliers based on your data)
const ugcConversionMultiplier = 1.85 // 85% increase
const ugcCostMultiplier = 0.4 // 60% lower CPC

const ugcConversions = (adSpend / (CPC * ugcCostMultiplier)) * ((conversionRate * ugcConversionMultiplier) / 100)
const ugcRevenue = ugcConversions * AOV

const revenueIncrease = ugcRevenue - baseRevenue
const percentageIncrease = ((ugcRevenue / baseRevenue) - 1) * 100
